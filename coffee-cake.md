Often you'll want coffee cake for the morning. This cake can take a while to prep, bake, and cool, so we recommend doing steps 2-4 the night before. Budget 90 minutes the morning of for baking and cooling.

1) Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and heat to 350 degrees. 

2) Grease a tube or 8x8 square pan.

3) Place the flour, granulated sugar, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, and the cinnamon in a food processor and process to combine. Transfer 1 1/4 cups of the mixture to a small bowl and stir in the remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar; set aside (this will be the streusel for the inside of the cake). Add the butter to teh remaining dry ingredients in the food processor bowl. Process the mixture until the butter has been broken down into small pebbly pieces, about ten 1-second pulses. Set aside.

4) Combine eggs, 1 cup of sour cream, and the vanilla in a medium bowl. In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt at low speed, about 30 seconds.

5) Add the butter and remaining 1/2 cup sour cream and mix a low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened. Increase to medium speed and beat 30 seconds. Scape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Decrease the mixer speed to medium-low and slowly incorporate the egg mixture in 3 additions, beating for 20 seconds after each addition and scraping th sides of the bowl as necessary. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat for 1 minute (batter should increase in volume and becomes aerated and pale in color).

6) Add 1 1/2 cups of the batter to the prepared pan, smoothing the surface with a spatula. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup of the streusal filling (without butter). Drop 1 1/2 cups of the batter over the streusel, spread evenly, and then add the remaining streusel filling. Top with the remaining batter and then the streusel topping (with butter). 

7) Bake until the cake feels firm to the touch and a toothpick or thin skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. 50 to 60 minutes for a tube pan, or 70-80 minutes for a square pan.

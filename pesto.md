# Pesto

The basic recipe is one of ratios. I usually just use as much basil as I have and base other quantities off that. You will need a baking/cooking scale, which I usually set to metric units (grams). This pesto is very garlicy, so use less if you want.

- 1 part fresh basil
- 1 part pine nuts
- 3 to 3.5 parts Parmesian cheese (block)
- 1/2 part garlic (peeled) and roughly chopped 
- lemon wedge(s)
- olive oil
- salt & pepper to taste

1) Measure the mass of the basil leaves. Use it to calculate (roughly) how much you'll need of each of the other ingredients.
2) Wash and dry basil in salad spinner if necessary. Use dish (or paper) towel to get as much of the moisture off the leaves as possible.
3) Measure out the solid block(s) of Parmesian cheese that you'll need. Either shred by hand or use the cheese grater on the food processor to shred. If you using a food processor, empty cheese into another bowl.
4) Add basil, pine nuts, cheese and garlic to food processor. Douse with a few glugs of olive oil and sprinkle some salt and pepper (you can always add more later).
5) Turn of food processor until pesto has consistent texture (~30-60 seconds). Taste the pesto and adjust salt, pepper, and lemon juice gradually.  Repeat one or two more times.

I usually put this pesto into a few containers, one for the fridge and others for the freezer.

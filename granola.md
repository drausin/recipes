# Granola

The basic ratio is 6 parts dry to 1 part wet. Follow that, and you'll be good. I like a well-seasoned granola, but feel free to scale back on the salt if you're so inclined.

- 4 cup rolled oats (i.e., not quick-cooking)
- 1 cup subflower seeds
- 1 cup chopped dry-roasted almonds
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp nutmeg
- 1 tsp cloves
- 1/2 cup coconut oil
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3/2 cups dried tart Montgomery cherries
- 1/2 cups minced crystalized ginger (optional)

1) Heat oven to 325 F.
2) Mix dry ingredients in large pot.
3) Melt coconut oil over low-medium heat in small sauce pan. Add maple syrup and mix. Remove from heat and let cool somewhat. Add vanilla.
4) Slowly pour wet mixture into dry, mixing thoroughly with a spoon or spatula as you go. Ensure dry mixture is as equally coated with wet as possible.
5) Spread evenly on a single large baking tray, yielding roughly 1/2 inch thick across entire tray. Even out with spatula or spoon, but don't pat down too much.
6) Bake for 40 mins. Rotate tray after 20 mins. This will yield a lightly toasted granola. If you prefer non-toasted flavor, cook for 30 mins instead.
7) Let tray cool completely (i.e., perhaps a few hours). Scrap granola off with spatual back into pot. Break up large chunks. Add dried cherries and mix thoroughly.

Store in sealed container or bag in freezer.

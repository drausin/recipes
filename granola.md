# Granola

The basic ratio is 6 parts dry to 1.25 part wet. Follow that, and you'll be good. I like a well-seasoned granola, but feel free to scale back on the salt if you're so inclined. If you don't use the wheat germ, you can scale back to 1 part wet instead of 1.25.

Yields 2 baking sheets of granola

- 6 cups rolled oats (i.e., not quick-cooking)
- 2 cups coconut flakes
- 2 cups pumkin seeds
- 2 cups chopped dry-roasted almonds
- 1/2 cup wheat germ (optional)
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 2 tsp nutmeg
- 2 tsp cloves
- 1.25 cups coconut oil
- 1.25 cups maple syrup
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup chia seeds
- 3 cups dried tart Montmorency cherries
- 1 cups minced crystalized ginger (optional)

1) Heat oven to 325 F.
2) Mix dry ingredients in large pot.
3) Melt coconut oil over low-medium heat in small sauce pan. Pour back into measuring up to ensure proper amount. Add maple syrup and mix. Mix in brown sugar. Remove from heat and let cool somewhat. Add vanilla and chia seeds.
4) Slowly pour wet mixture into dry, mixing thoroughly with a spoon or spatula as you go. Ensure dry mixture is as equally coated with wet as possible.
5) Spread evenly on a two large baking trays lined with parchment paper, yielding roughly 1/2 inch thick across entire tray. Even out with spatula or spoon, but don't pat down too much.
6) Bake for 40 mins. Rotate tray after 20 mins. This will yield a lightly toasted granola. If you prefer non-toasted flavor, cook for 30 mins instead.
7) Let tray cool completely (i.e., perhaps a few hours). Scrap granola off with spatual back into pot. Break up large chunks. Add dried cherries and ginger and mix thoroughly.

Store in sealed container or bag at room temp (if finishing in 2-3 weeks) or freezer.

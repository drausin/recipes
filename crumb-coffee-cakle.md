Below I've given the original recipe for an 8x8 pan, and my adjusted one for a larger 9x13 pan, which also has a slightly larger crumb/cake ratio.

Crumbs

| 8x8 Pan	| 13x9 Pan	| Ingredient |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 tablespoons (140 grams)	| 20 tablespoons (280 grams)	| Unsalted butter, melted |
| 1/2 cup (110 grams)	| 1 cup (220 grams)	| Dark brown sugar |
| 1/4 cup (50 grams)	| 1/2 cup (100 grams)	| Granulated sugar |
| 1 1/4 teaspoons	| 2 1/2 teaspoons	| Ground cinnamon |
| 1/4 teaspoon	| 3/4 teaspoon	| Kosher salt |
| 1 2/3 cups (215 grams)	| 3 1/3 cups (430 grams)	| All-purpose flour |

Cake

| 8x8 Pan	| 13x9 Pan	| Ingredient |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 tablespoons (85 grams)	| 9 tablespoons (128 grams)	| Unsalted butter, softened |
| 1/2 cup (100 grams)	| 3/4 cup (150 grams)	| Granulated sugar |
| 1 egg	| 1.5 eggs	| Large egg |
| 1/2 cup (120 grams)	| 3/4 cup (180 grams)	| Sour cream |
| 2 tablespoons (30 ml)	| 3 tablespoons (45 ml)	| Water or milk |
| 1 teaspoon (5 ml)	| 1.5 teaspoons (7.5 ml)	| Vanilla extract |
| 1 cup (130 grams)	| 1.5 cups (195 grams)	| All-purpose flour |
| 1 1/4 teaspoons	| 2 teaspoons (approximately)	| Baking powder |
| 3/4 teaspoon	| 1 1/4 teaspoons	| Kosher salt |

1) Heat oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly coat the pan with butter or nonstick spray. For extra security, line it with parchment paper with the tails sticking up on the sides.
2) Make crumbs. Whisk butter, sugars, cinnamon, and salt together until evenly mixed. Add flour and mix until it disappears. It’s going to be very thick; press it evenly into the bottom of the bowl and set it aside.
3) Make cake. Beat butter with sugar until lightened and fluffy. Add egg, water or milk, sour cream, and vanilla and beat until combined. Sprinkle surface of batter with baking powder and salt, and beat well to combine. Add flour and mix only until it disappears.
4) Scrape batter into prepared cake pan and smooth it flat. Use a spoon to loosen the crumbs from the bottom of the bowl where they’ve rested, breaking them up into big and small rubble. Sprinkle evenly over the batter.
5) Bake for about 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake just below the crumbs comes out batter-free. Check in a few spots, in case it has baked unevenly.
6) Cool to lukewarm. Remove using parchment paper tails onto a cooling rack to cool further.  Dust generously with powdered sugar and cutting the cake into squares or wedges.

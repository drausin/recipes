# Falafel

- 1 lb bag of dried chickpeas
- 2 bunches of fresh parsley
- 1 medium red onion
- 1 Tbsp salt
- 1 Tbsp harissa spice mix
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp cardamom

## Prepare ahead of time
I make this across two bowls because my food processor isn't big enough for everything to fit into it.

1) Soak chickeas overnight in a bowl of water. Drain and separate them into two bowls.
2) Cut stems off parsley and chop roughly. Put one bunch in each bowl.
3) Peel and cut onion roughly. Put half in each bowl.
4) Put parsely and onion in the bottom of the food processor. Put half (one bowl's) chickpeas on top.
5) Add half the spices into the food processor.
6) Pulse and scrape down sides with spatula to mix thoroughly.
7) Empty mix into the bowl. Repeat with contents of other bowl and other half of the spices.
8) Combine both bowls' mixes with spatula.
9) Squeeze with tablespoon and hands into balls placed on a plate. Layer with parchment paper and wrap in a plastic bag.
10) Freeze for 2 days. Remove balls from plate and put into a Ziploc bag kept in the freezer.

## Make the day of

1) Heat 1" canola oil in a small sauce or frying pan to 375 F.
2) Place with fork many frozen (or freshly made) falafel in the pan as will fit. OK if not fully submerged.
3) Cook until medium-dark brown. Carefully flip them using a fork to cook the other side.

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1.5 tsp sugar
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 0.5 inch cubes and chilled in freezer
- 1.25 cups buttermilk plus more for brushing

Makes 8 biscuits. The rectangular shape of the biscuits prevents any dough waste while minimizing how much you must work it.

1) Preheat oven to 425 F and fill baking tray on the lower rack with a cm or so of water.
2) Whisk the flour, baking powder, kosher salt, sugar, and baking soda in a large bowl. Using your hands, smash the butter into the flour mixture. It should be almost like you’re making pie dough (you’ve made pie dough before, right?), with little bits of butter but no large chunks.
3) Drizzle half the buttermilk all over the dry mixture and, using a wooden spoon or, better yet, your hands, mix everything until it comes together. Add the remaining half of buttermilk and mix until it comes together into a sort of ball. Knead the mixture a few times in the bowl, making sure to get any of those dry bits at the bottom up into the mix.
4) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead another two or three times. 
5) Pat the dough into a 1 ½-inch-thick rectangle about 9 inches long and 5 inches wide. (Optional: Refrigerate for 1–48 hours ahead of time before slicing and baking.) Cut it in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 4 pieces (you should get 8 biscuits). Alternatively, you can pat the dough into a 1 ½ -inch-thick disk (or whatever shape) and punch out 2-inch circles.
6) Bake, rotating once, until the biscuits are deeply golden brown on the bottoms and tops, and the sides have puffed up like an accordion, 20 to 25 minutes.
7) Remove biscuits with and cool on rack or in a bowl lined and covered with a cloth or napkin.

Credit: Thomas Keller

- 2 cups cake flour
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 Tbsp kosher salt
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 0.5 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 0.25 inch cubes and chilled in freezer
- 1.5 cups buttermilk

Makes 12 large biscuits or 18 smaller ones. It also comes out well if you want to halve the recipe. The basic thing is to mix and handle the dough as little as possible to avoid developing the gluten. The rectangular shape of the biscuits prevents any dough waste while minimizing how much you must work it.

1) Preheat oven to 425 F.
2) Combine dry ingredients in food processor and pulse a few times to mix.
3) Add chilled butter cubes to dry ingredients and mix loosely with spatula.
4) Pulse food processor about 4 times for 1 second each until butter pieces are roughly pea-sized.
5) Dump mixture into large bowl. Pour buttermilk into it and gently fold dry ingredientes into it. It will be clumpy and shouldn't quite come together.
6) Dump mixture onto counter and form/pat it into rectangle 1 to 1.5 inches high and sides ratio of roughly 2:3.
7) Using a pastry scraper or large metal spatula, cut the rectangle into thirds along it's long side. Using the pastry scraper or spatual, stack one of the end thirds into the middle third and then the other end third into the existing stack. Squish the dough down with your hand and the scraper/spatula into a new rectangle, roughly the same size as the original one. It will fall apart a bit around the border. That's ok. Use the scraper/spatula to push the cumbs around the edges back into the dough.
8) With a large knife, cut the rectangle into thirds along the shorter side and into either fourths or sixths along the longer edge. You make find it useful to draw the cuts lightly with the knife before making the cuts to ensure you have biscuits the size you want.
9) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using the metal spatula, carefully transfer each biscuit to a baking sheet. Bake for 15-18 minutes, until tops become golden brown.
10) Remove biscuits with and cool on rack.

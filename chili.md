Credit: Susan (my step-mother)

- 3 onions, minced
- 3 lbs ground chuck
- 3 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 8 garlic cloves (or more), minced
- 1/4 cup chili powder
- 1/4 cup tomato paste
- 1 Tbsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 15 oz can tomato sauce
- 15 oz can diced tomatoes
- 15 oz can red kidney beans
- 15 oz can black beans
- 2 cups frozen corn (or more)
- 2-4 Tbsp diced dried hot peppers (e.g., chipotle)
- 1 stout beer (e.g., Guiness)

The most important ingredient is time. Taste the chili every 15-20 mins when you stir to track how the flavors are developing. At the beginning they will feel somewhat flat, butafter 4 hours or so should be much richer and have more depth. Season with salt and pepper gradually over this process. 

1) Heat oil in large dutch oven over medium to high heat until shimmering.
2) Brown beef and add onions & garlic. Cook until softened.
3) Add chili poweder, oregano, cumin, red pepper flakes. Stir for 3 mins.
4) Add tomatoes with juice, beans, and corn. Add hot peppers.
5) Simmer over low heat (should just be bubbling) for 6+ hours. Stir every 15-20 minutes.
6) Add beer after 4+ hours.
